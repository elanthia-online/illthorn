## Developer Installation

**From The Command Line**

- Have Node
- Clone the repository or download the [.zip](https://github.com/elanthia-online/illthorn/archive/master.zip).
- Navigate to the directory and install dependencies with `yarn install`.
- You can then launch Illthorn with `yarn start`
- Or make an app file with `yarn make` (look for the executable in `/out/`)

## Connecting to the Game

You need to have an active Lich session. So you'd connect something like...

```
ruby lich.rb --login CHARACTER_NAME --detachable-client=8003 --without-frontend
```

Lich might also be `lich.rbw` on your setup. You can run multiple connections (for multiple characters/accounts) in multiple terminals and Illtorn will autodetect them. You'll have to run them on different ports though, like `--detachable-client=8004`.

## Current Features

- Runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux ([Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/support))
- Attempts to autostart sessions by detecting open Lich processes started with `--without-frontend`
- Runs multiple sessions in a single app (alt-# between them)
- Highlights names/monsters/etc
- Autocomplete command history
- Multiple themes to choose from
- Zoom in/out (like a web browser)
- Optional Streams panel for LNet, ESP, and Deaths

## Planned Features

- [ ] Plugin Interface
- [x] Custom Highlights
- [ ] Macros
- [ ] Saved Logging
- [ ] Download Public Themes
- [x] Clickable links in game feed and ESP/LNet

## Meta Shortcuts

Meta shortcuts are not customizable, as this project will general prefer sane defaults over configuration

#### `alt+<n>`

Quick swap between sessions based on the numeric order on the left-hand session pane, similar to many modern terminals

## CLI Commands (Vim prefixed)

All FE commands are prefixed by the `:` character, ala `vim` or other common CLI utils.

#### `:theme <name>`

Change the active theme.

- `original`
- `rogue`
- `dark-king`
- `icemule`
- `kobold`
- `raging-thrak`

#### `:connect <name> <port>`

Also has an alias: `:c <name> <port>`

Attempts to create a new named session with the given arguments. If `name` and `port` are omitted, it will attempt to autodetect any newly created Lich processes.

If `port` is omitted we will attempt to autodetect which port to connect to.

#### `:focus <session>`

Swaps focus to another session.

There is also an alias: `:f <session>`

#### `:rename <new name>`

Renames the currently focused session.

#### `:swap <other name>`

If you accidentally mixed up the name/port combos when connecting, this allows you to easily swap between the names.

#### `:set <path> <value>`

Sets a configuration path to a value.

Currently supported `:set` operations:
| path | value | description |
|-------------|:---------|---------------------------------------------|
| clickable | boolean | turns clickable `<d cmd>` elements on or off|

#### `:ui <name> <state>`

Sets the panels. State is `on` or `off`. Names are:

- `vitals`
- `injuries`
- `active-spells`
- `compass`

Example: `:ui compass off`

#### `:stream <name> <state>`

Sets the stream panels. State is `on` or `off`. Names are:

- `thoughts`
- `speech`
- `logon`
- `logoff`
- `death`

Example: `:stream thoughts on`

#### `:config`

Display current configuration for Illthorn.

#### `:hilite add <group> <pattern>`

Adds a regular expression to the specified highlight group.

#### `:hilite group <group> <css-property>=<css-value>`

Specifies a set of CSS properties to apply to a given group highlight. Multiple property-value pairs can be specified for a group. Typical properties include:

1.  `color` for foreground color.
2.  `background-color` for background color.
3.  `font-weight` to make text bold.
4.  `font-style` to make text italics.

#### `:hilite reload`

Reload highlight configuration.

#### `:hilite remove <type> <text>`

Removes the type of hilight object matching the `text` entry. `type` must be either "pattern" for a pattern that is matched, or "group" for the specification of how to handle matches, as described in previous sections. This group must be run using `:sudo`. If a group is being removed, and patterns are still assigned to that group, the command needs to include the phrase `confirm` (e.g. `:hilite remove group confirm <text>`).

## Autocomplete

Previous commands in a session are saved and will show a ghosted version as you type characters which you can autocomplete by pressing the **right arrow** key to complete the command.
